-------------------TERRAFORM-----------------------
Terraform is a tool for building, changing and versioning infrastructures safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions.
The infrastructure terraform can manage includes lowlevel components such as compute instances, storage and networking as well as high level componants such as DNS entries SAAS features etc.

Key features: Infra as a code, executing plans, resource graph and change automation.

Creating ec2-instance by using access key and secret accesskey:

Step1: create a dierectory. Ex: mkdir terraform-ajay && cd terraform-ajay

Step2: create ec2-instance.tf file. Here ext “tf” resembles terraform and we need to save files with ext “.tf” . 

provider "aws" {
  access_key = "ACCESS_ID"
  secret_key = "Seceret_Access_ID"
  region     = "us-east-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "demo" {
  ami           = "ami-02bcbb802e03574ba"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags {
    Name = “demo”
    Batch = “10AM”
  }
}
